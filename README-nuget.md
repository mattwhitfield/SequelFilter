# SequelFilter

# Introduction üëÄ
Sequel Filter is a C# library that allows for filtering using a SQL-like syntax. The idea is to be able to provide end-users with completely customizable filtering without having to allow them to provide their own code or write your own filtering logic.

## Library Features üìö

* Simple injection-free filtering logic
* Support for matching single objects or filtering `IEnumerable`s
* Lightweight dependencies (only Irony parser required)

## Grammar Features ‚úç

* Basic comparisons with support for loose type matching
* Combinational logic with `AND` / `OR`
* Support for `IN`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN` and `IS NULL` SQL operators
* Support for searching child enumerables with `HAS_NONE`, `HAS_ANY`, `HAS_SINGLE`

# Support ü§ù

If you'd like to support the project but you don't want to contribute code - a really good way to help is spread the word. There isn't a donation or financial option because honestly I don't need donations. I am, however, rubbish at 'marketing'. So any help there would be greatly appreciated! Whether it's a blog post or just telling some folks at the office - every little helps.
